description: Reflections on coming to STEM late in life
---

This is a bit of a different post for me.

Next year I'm going to be starting a masters that is entirely computer science, statistics, applied analytics focused. But I don't have a STEM background. I wrote about my experiences in STEM and realising I wasn't as bad at maths as I thought I was [here](https://medium.com/@ellenbroad/youre-not-as-bad-at-stem-as-you-think-you-are-a8727450d0f6#.hapcwuco4 "you're not as bad at STEM as you think you are").
