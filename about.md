I'm a data policy wonk and data tinkerer, who moved back to Australia in September 2016 after working in London, the Hague and Paris.

While in the UK I was Head of Policy for the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/), an international organisation headquartered in London and co-founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, and Sir Nigel Shadbolt, a leading expert in artificial intelligence. I also worked for senior UK government minister Elisabeth Truss as her expert adviser on data. Since moving back to Australia I've worked as an independent [consultant](http://ellenbroad.com/consulting) for a range of organisations, including CSIRO's Data61, federal and state government departments and universities.

I write about open data, data ethics, privacy and AI-type things in various places. Some are linked to from my [blog](http://ellenbroad.com/blog/). I've been published in the Guardian, the New Scientist, the Royal Statistical Society's StatsLife, the Australian Centre for Ethics and a range of technology and policy publications. I also speak about data issues in various settings in Australia and overseas. You might have heard me talking about artificial intelligence and data ethics for [ABC Radio National's 'Big Ideas' program](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/ethical-machines/8738670), or on [Future Tense](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/futuretense/robots-and-ai/8804292). Speaking at SXSW in 2017 about data anonymisation and a project I was involved with anonymising 75 years of British food diary data was a 2017 highlight. I have a book coming out with Melbourne University Publishing called [Made by Humans: The AI Condition](https://www.mup.com.au/books/9780522873313-made-by-humans) on 30 July 2018.

I like science fiction films, board games and pop music and I like incorporating these into data-related work [wherever I can](https://twitter.com/peterkwells/status/609727042855268352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). I even co-designed a [board game about open data](http://theodi.org/news/you-can-now-buy-your-own-copy-of-datopolis-the-open-data-board-game) with Jeni Tennison that's been picked up in 19 countries.
